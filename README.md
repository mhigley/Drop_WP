# Drop_WP, a WordPress starter theme with Gulp and Sass

Drop_WP is a starter theme heavily influenced from the amazing Sip theme that is based on Automattic’s [Underscores](http://underscores.me/), enhanced with a basic Sass framework and a minimal [Gulp](https://codeable.io/community/speed-up-your-theme-development-with-gulp/) setup that serves as a base to build on for improved theme development workflow.

```
$ cd /your/WordPress/wp-content/themes/
$ git clone git@github.com:mhigley/Drop_WP.git
```

### Points of interest

Take a look at the `gulpfile.js`, which contains the necessary tasks and then explore the nicely organized Sass framework in `/scss`. If you need a more comprehensive tutorial on using this theme, take a look [here](https://codeable.io/community/introducing-sip-a-starter-theme-with-gulp-workflow/)
